# Hades3310

**There is no escape from Hell! Or is it?**

*You're a son of a Greek god of death Hades, wanting to escape the Land of the Dead and reach Olympus. 
A rogue-like game (or rogue-lite maybe). After you die, you start over again, but you keep all your money and all permanent upgrades that were bought in the shop.*
